World Meets Me, Myself, and My Work

This is an adventure! I am a complete novice at coding. This is my project to become familiar with and practice coding to build my website and app. There will be mistakes. I accept mistakes as learning opportunities; So, be sure to provide feedbacks that can help me improve every step of my adventure. 

For this first project, C4Q h.w. assignment is to create a web resume of some sort. I am building a simple one - or at lest trying to - that is elegant and does not scream too flashy. My goal is to show my grasp of understanding of the concept and application of HTML and CSS. However, I do not want to give a false impression that I know it all; I do not! So, when you see a fancy display of work, that's from an inspiration - think of it as what I want to be able to acheive naturally. Of couse, it will also show that I understand how the codes in HTML and CSS works for that 'fancy' section. 

Here is to you, the viewers who are about to endure with me the journey of a code time! Sit back, relax, and enjoy!
